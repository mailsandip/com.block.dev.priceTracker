# priceTracker

This App gets the live prices of top 100 crypto from the Coingecko services, and show them in a nicely formatted SAPUI5/OpenUI5 App. This Ui5 app uses the UI5-tooling to gernerate the skeleton. 
As of now, I have used the Coingecko REST services to fetch the live prices. I will create another version of it using the javascript APIs. 
I could have used reactjs and some bootstrap js to create the front end. But I like to experiment using the OpenUi5 framework. 
Here is a screenshot of the App

I will enhance this App by using Micro Charts, Srearch, Coin Info etc etc
